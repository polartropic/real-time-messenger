## Project Description
ThunderTeam is a work collaboration application, offering the ability to:
- **Create and edit accounts**: <br>
  Once an unregistered user opens the application, they are prompted to create an account or log in via the landing page for unregistered users. In addition, every registered user has the option to change their personal details once the account is already created.
- **Live chat with people**: <br>
  Each registered user has the option to create a live chat with any other user or users on the app. After successful chat creation, every participant can see who is also a part of the chat and start sending messages. A message can contain text and/or emojis and each message can be reacted to or edited by the author.
- **Create teams and team channels**: <br>
  The teams in the application are a big part of what makes the ThunderTeam a great collaboration tool. Every registered user can create a team and make whoever they want a part of it by using the handy user search bar that appears when the Create a team button is clicked. Once a user has created their own team, they become the team's owner, which gives them the ability to add or remove other users from the team. In addition, any of the team members can create team channels where they can chat with the channel participants and schedule team meetings.
- **Schedule meetings and call other people with audio/camera**: <br>
  Each user is able to schedule a meeting in a personal chat or team channel. After this is done, the meeting will appear in the calendar section, where each meeting could be joined by the invited users. Once the meeting has started, the participants have the option to talk to each other via audio/camera, use the meeting chat, share their screen, take advantage of the different plugins such as using Excalidraw together or drawing on a whiteboard.
